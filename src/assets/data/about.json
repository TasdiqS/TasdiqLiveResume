            "description": "My path as a <i>programmer</i> has started at nineteen years old, when I've fallen in love with <i>Logo</i>, an educational programming language used to captivate kids in the wonderful lands of <i>Programming</i>. I used to spend hours in a row trying to build figures and animations, using math and geometry. At that time, I just did not know the exciting challenges that were yet to come.<br><br>A few years later, I got an internship as a <i>Webmaster</i>, since then, I have never stopped. It has been more than a decade, where I'm having the chance to work with marvelous people, learning every day, traveling the world, and mainly, always making great friendships.<br><br>I had an entrepreneurship experience, when a friend of mine presented me <i>Magento</i>, an extremely popular e-commerce framework. After doing several courses and a lot of practice, I got contracts with agencies from SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This entrepreneurship experience gave me the chance to see the other side of the coin, which contributed to sort of expand a bit more my consciousness as an employee.<br><br>Nowadays, I keep seeking new skills, learning and sharing my humble knowledge as much as possible."
